# security_scripts

This is a collection of simple scripts I've used to automate security tasks.

These functions can very likely be done by more sophisticated software packages. Sophisticated tools may not always be available, especially when you're acting as a third party assessor on a host network.

Maybe your laptop isn't authorized on the local defender's network.
Maybe firewalls are blocking the ports needed to use your tools.
Maybe your laptop got destroyed in transit.

Having scripts that rely on native tools like bash and powershell in your backpocket can save you time if your more sophisticated tools aren't available.

These specific scripts were designed to be used in a limited scope by security professionals. Input validation and some other best practices are not utilized.
